# for-Tristan

The data is made of Vector and ADCP data (all in NetCDF).

The goal is to create quiver plots from data at all three sites (Gutter, Shark Alley, Green Point) - so they can be compared. 
- The Gutter data is split into 3 datasets (3 sampling windows with battery exchange in between)
- Shark Alley is split to 2 for the same reason
- Green Point is split to 4 

For now, the Vector data (Gutter & Shark Alley) - are in one notebook (07_Vec_Feather_All-Tristan.ipynb) 
and the ADCP is in another notebook ( )
